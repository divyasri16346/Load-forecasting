# Deep Learning for Load Power Forecasting & Proactive Load Shedding

> Forecast household electricity consumption using deep learning and automatically identify high-load periods for sustainable power grid management.

## 💡 Project Highlights

- Forecasts energy usage using 12-hour historical windows.
- Proactively sheds load when consumption crosses a threshold.
- Compares GRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and N-BEATS-inspired models.
- Achieved **R² = 0.934**, **Precision = 89%**, **Recall = 70%** on peak load detection with Bi-LSTM.
- Real-world sustainability impact: Avoid grid overloads, improve energy efficiency.
